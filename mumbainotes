SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT
a.	Local version control System
b.	Centralized version control system
c.	Distributed version control system

Centralized version control system: 
a.	It is not locally available, meaning we always need to be connected to a network to perform any action.
b.	Since everything is centralized, if central server gets failed, we will lose entire data e.g. SVN tool.
