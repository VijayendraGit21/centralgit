SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT
a.	Local version control System
b.	Centralized version control system
c.	Distributed version control system

Centralized version control system: 
a.	It is not locally available, meaning we always need to be connected to a network to perform any action.
b.	Since everything is centralized, if central server gets failed, we will lose entire data e.g. SVN tool.
Distributed version control system
In Distributed version control system, every contributor has a local copy or clone of the main repository i.e. everyone maintain a repository of their own which contain all the files & metadata present in main repository.
